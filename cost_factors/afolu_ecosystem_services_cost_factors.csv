area_lndu_forests_primary,500,$/ha,1,cb:lndu:ecosystem_services:forests:primary,Value of ecosystem services (avoided loss of primary forest),0,$2000/ha,"The value of ecosystem services of forests is deeply uncertain and varies widely (Taye et al., 2021, Table 7, averaged across tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate biomes; Costanza et al., 2011, Table S.1). Here we assume that any transition of primary forests is the result of deforestation that results in cleared land for crops or pasture, which have low ecosystem service value by comparison.  The values used are intended to represent ecosystem service value lost, exclusive of both food provisioning and carbon sequestration, which are accounted for separately in our study.",none
