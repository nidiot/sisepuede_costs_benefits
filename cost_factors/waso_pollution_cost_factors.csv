qty_waso_open_dump_*,-115,$/ton,1,cb:waso:env_pollution:open_dumping:X,Avoided cost of waste pollution (open dumping),1,$115/ton of waste dumped,"Wilson et al. (2015) suggest a “conservative” cost of $20-50/capita/year from unmanaged waste, and describe average waste of 220kg/cap/year among the poorest. We calculate costs assuming $20/capita and 0.22 ton/capita, adjusted from 2015 to 2019 dollars."
