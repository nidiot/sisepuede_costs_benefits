In the United States, light duty EVs are estimated to have approximately $12,000 of higher up front cost (Baik et al., 2019) than traditional LDVs and have $949/year lower maintenance costs (AAA, 2019) than their ICE counterparts. We approximate that charging infrastructure may involve an additional $1000 in capital cost per EV, consistent with data from the United States on the costs (Purnazeri, 2022) and deployment of charging stations (evadoption, 2021). The per-km capital cost shown in the table assumes vehicles are driven 15,000 kilometers per year (Ecola et al., 2008) and have a 12-year lifespan, consistent with data on vehicle lifetimes in the United States (BTS, undated).
